#Angular 2 Starter

## First steps
First of all, you need to install dependencies. 
Make sure you have [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. 
Then, open a terminal on the root project folder and type:

`$ npm install`

When installation process is complete, you can easily run the app typing:

`$ npm start`

This command will compile your scripts, run a lite server and keep watching to live reloading your app when changes occur.
